# Heart
This project is an interactive, web-based visualization and simulation of the human heart designed to educate users about its anatomy, function, and rhythm. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or any other relevant tech stack), it demonstrates the structure of the heart, blood flow, and how each chamber works in sync.
